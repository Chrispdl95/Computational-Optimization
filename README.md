Computational Optimization


In this repository  i implemented  some commonly used algorithms for optimization problems. We'll take a look at Presolve Techniques, Scaling Techniques and an Exterior Point Algorithm. All of them will be tested on different matrices.
Briefly, the repository  contains:
• Compressed Sparse Row (CSR). Representation of a matrix A by three (one-dimensional) arrays, that respectively contain nonzero values, the extents of rows, and column indices.

•Compressed Sparse Column (CSC). Representation of a matrix A by three (one-dimensional) arrays, that respectively contain nonzero values, the extents of columns, and row indices.

•Equilibration (Scaling Technique). Rows and columns of a matrix A are multiplied by positive scalars and these operations lead to non-zero numerical values of similar magnitude.

•Eliminate k-ton Equality Constraints (Presolve Method). Identifying and eliminating  k-ton equality constraints in order to reduce the size of the problem and discover whether a LP is unbounded or infeasible.

•Exterior Point Simplex-type Algorithm. An implementation of Exterior Point Algorithm.
